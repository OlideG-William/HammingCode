First, enter a given number from 0 and 1 (where the length of any size), then the coding algorithm encodes our data and displays the message. After outputting the result, enter the position you want to distort (where you do not need to write the number again, but only the position where you want to distort) (it automatically changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0) and immediately indicates where the error was, and at which position). distortion, this number goes to a method that decodes our distorted number, and outputs the number to the distortion where it goes. And finally displays our initial number (data).
